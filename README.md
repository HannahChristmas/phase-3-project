# Phase 3 Final Project- National Parks

## Overview

This application allows users to learn more about the National Parks at All Parks and add their own at Add A Park. At All Parks, users are able to view, edit, update, and delete parks. At Add A Park, users can add a park name, state, and description. If the state already exists in the database, it will appear in the autofilled list. If the state does not exist yet, it will automatically add the new state on submit.
